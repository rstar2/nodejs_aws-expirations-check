env:
  # 1. AWS_REGION is reserved env variable from AWS and cannot be set/changed
  # it is always provided in the function later
  # That's why we have to use it only internally and not deploy as env variable
  # 2. use as prop thta could be changed/set ony here and both Serverless-deploy and local AWS-SDK will use the same region
  # 3. this process.env.AWS_REGION is used internally by the AWS-SDK to configure its access to services like DynomoDB, etc.
  AWS_REGION:

  # NOTE!!! in order to make the 'aws-sdk' module (or the 'aws' cli)
	# we have to set some credentials. Easiest way is to create a new profile (in the .aws/credentials file)
	# that has credentials (e.g. key/secret) to an AWS IAM user with such credentials and who has
	# proper permissions/policies defined (in this case to access the DynamoDB table).
	# The 'AWS_PROFILE' environment variable is used to configure implicitly the 'aws-sdk'.
  AWS_PROFILE:

  # the secret "token" used to secure an allowed function to call another
  # also used as identifier for the invoking event
  # this env variable should be set to both functions
  AWS_LAMBDA_API_SECRET:

  # used to sign and verify JWT tokens for the authorization mechanizm (generated with require('bcryptjs').genSaltSync(10))

  # used to create hashes for passwords (generated with require('bcryptjs').genSaltSync(10))
